# railroad-ink
This is a pet project inspired by the game [Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/9c/f7/6c-railroad-ink-deep-blue-edition-rulebook.pdf)

As of now, it can be used to roll dices for each round of the game.

Some implementation concepts and data model choices were inspired by [railroad-think project](https://github.com/Havegum/railroad-think)
